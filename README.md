## About this Project
The raw data was in an Excel worksheet with 3 sheets: Listings, Reviews and Calendar. After I uploaded it to Tableau, I used an inner join to connect the Listings sheet with the Calendar sheet. Then I built my visualisations in separate sheets and inserted them all into a dashboard.

### Inner Join
